Cosmonaut
=====================================

Cosmonaut is a supercharged SDK with object mapping capabilities that enables .NET developers to work with CosmosDB. 
It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write while providing a fluent API 
for all of it's operations and ORM support.
